                    Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Guy Neeman</strong>. I currently go to an Informatics School in Winterthur, Switzerland.
                    I'm 17 years old and I started my coding journey a few years ago. I am currently studying
                    <strong> Software Development</strong>.
                    I enjoy turning ideas into functional applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey in programming started with curiosity about how websites and minecraft servers work.
                    Since then, I‚Äôve learned a lot about programming in multiple languages and I'm constantly learning more.
